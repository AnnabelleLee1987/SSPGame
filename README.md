# SSPGame

Implements "Stone, Paper, Scissors" Game in Java in a way that two computer player battle each other. The user can choose strategies for both players via command line and also define, how many rounds will be played. In each round the player choose one of the options: paper, stone or scissors. Paper beats stone, stone beats scissors and scissors beat paper. If both choose the same option, this results in a tie and the round will be repeated. While the rounds are played, the results of the round (choices, winner) s are printed out to the user. At the end of the game a statistic will be given out (score of both players, ties). Then the game is over.
